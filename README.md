AuToGraFS
=========

Automatic Topological Generator for Framework Structures

Manual coming soon...

AuToGraFS as downloaded is a drop-in replacement for the python ASE and you can install it in your user directory by following the "Manual Installation" instructions located at:

https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/download.html#manual-installation

Python requirements are the same as for the ASE, plus the argparse module. 

Some topologies do not work with the latest version of numpy. This is being fixed.
